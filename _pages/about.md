**PhD and intern application:** 2025 fall PhD is fulfilled. You can either apply for future PhDs or apply for [Internship or collaboration](https://forms.gle/zRcWP49qF9aR1VXW8). [[PhD and interns](https://jd92wang.notion.site/Professor-Jindong-Wang-from-William-Mary-is-Recruiting-Fully-Funded-PhD-Students-Interns-for-Fall-12eb4ea70d8e803cadebd1a9b75fd739?pvs=4)]  [[Chinese version](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/4827065042)]

**Research interest:** (See this [page](https://jd92.wang/research/) for more details)
- *General ML and AI*: To make AI systems more robust, trustworthy, and responsible. Key areas: robust machine learning, OOD / domain generalization, transfer learning, semi-supervised learning, federated learning, and related applications. These days, I'm particularly interested in ML with foundation models.
- *Philosophy of language models*: We mainly focus on understanding the potential and limitation of large foundation models. Related topics: LLM [evaluation](https://llm-eval.github.io/) and [enhancement](https://llm-enhance.github.io/), and agent behavior.
- *AI for social sciences*: How to measure the impact of generative AI on different domains? How to assist interdisciplinary domains using powerful AI models? How to use existing social science knowledge to help us better understand AI behaviors?

*I am open to industry and university visit, consultant, and more collaboration!*

Dr. Jindong Wang is a Tenure-Track Assistant Professor at Data Science, William & Mary. He was a Senior Researcher in Microsoft Research Asia from 2019 to 2024. His research interest includes machine learning, large language and foundation models, and AI for social science. Since 2022, he has been selected by Stanford University as one of the [World's Top 2% Highly Cited Scientists](https://ecebm.com/2023/10/04/stanford-university-names-worlds-top-2-scientists-2023/) and one of the [Most Influential AI Scholars](https://www.aminer.cn/ai2000?domain_ids=5dc122672ebaa6faa962c2a4) by AMiner. He serves as the associate editor of IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems (TNNLS), guest editor for ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST), area chair for ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR, KDD, ACL, ACMMM, and ACML, SPC of IJCAI and AAAI. He has published over 60 papers with 17000+ citations (H-index 47) at leading conferences and journals such as ICML, ICLR, NeurIPS, TPAMI, IJCV etc. His research is reported by [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lanceeliot/2023/11/11/the-answer-to-why-emotionally-worded-prompts-can-goose-generative-ai-into-better-answers-and-how-to-spur-a-decidedly-positive-rise-out-of-ai/?sh=38038fb137e5), [MIT Technology Review](https://www.mittrchina.com/news/detail/13596), and other international media. He received best and outstanding papers awards at several internation conferences and workshops. He published a book [Introduction to Transfer Learning](http://jd92.wang/tlbook) and gave tutorials at [IJCAI'22](https://dgresearch.github.io/), [WSDM'23](https://dgresearch.github.io/), [KDD'23](https://mltrust.github.io/), [AAAI'24](https://ood-timeseries.github.io/), and [AAAI'25](https://llm-understand.github.io/). He leads several impactful open-source projects, including [transferlearning](https://github.com/jindongwang/transferlearning), [PromptBench](https://github.com/microsoft/promptbench), [torchSSL](https://github.com/torchssl/torchssl), and [USB](https://github.com/microsoft/Semi-superised-learning), which received over 16K stars on Github. He obtained his Ph.D from University of Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2019 with the excellent PhD thesis award and a bachelor's degree from North China University of Technology in 2014.
