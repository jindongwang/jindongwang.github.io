**PhD and intern application:** You can apply for future [PhDs](https://jd92wang.notion.site/Professor-Jindong-Wang-from-William-Mary-is-Recruiting-Fully-Funded-PhD-Students-Interns-for-Fall-12eb4ea70d8e803cadebd1a9b75fd739?pvs=4) or [Internship or collaboration](https://forms.gle/zRcWP49qF9aR1VXW8). [[Chinese blog](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/4827065042)]

**Research interest:** (See this [page](https://jd92.wang/research/) for more details)
- *General ML and AI*: To make AI systems more robust, trustworthy, and responsible. Key areas: robust machine learning, OOD / domain generalization, transfer learning, semi-supervised learning, federated learning, and related applications. These days, I'm particularly interested in ML with foundation models.
- *Philosophy of language models*: We mainly focus on understanding the potential and limitation of large foundation models. Related topics: LLM [evaluation](https://llm-eval.github.io/) and [enhancement](https://llm-enhance.github.io/), and agent behavior.
- *AI for social sciences*: How to measure the impact of generative AI on different domains? How to assist interdisciplinary domains using powerful AI models? How to use existing social science knowledge to help us better understand AI behaviors?

*I am open to industry and university visit, consultant, and more collaboration!*

Dr. Jindong Wang is an Assistant Professor at Department of Data Science, William & Mary. He is also a faculty member of [Future of Life Institute](https://futureoflife.org/person/jindong-wang/). Previously, he was a Senior Researcher in Microsoft Research Asia from 2019 to 2024. His research interest spans machine learning, large language and foundation models, and AI for social science. He is among [World's Top 2% Highly Cited Scientists](https://ecebm.com/2023/10/04/stanford-university-names-worlds-top-2-scientists-2023/) and [Most Influential AI Scholars](https://www.aminer.cn/ai2000?domain_ids=5dc122672ebaa6faa962c2a4). He serves as associate editor of IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems (TNNLS), guest editor for ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST), area chair for ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR, KDD, ACL, ACMMM, and ACML, and SPC of IJCAI and AAAI. He published over 60 papers with 22000+ citations (H-index 52) at top-tier venues. His research was integrated into Microsoft [health products](https://isthmus.com/news/cover-story/epic-and-microsoft-partner-up/) that reduced token consumptions by 15%, and [quant finance](https://www.vadim.blog/qlib-ai-quant-workflow-adarnn) with increased prediction accuracy.
His work was also reported by [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lanceeliot/2023/11/11/the-answer-to-why-emotionally-worded-prompts-can-goose-generative-ai-into-better-answers-and-how-to-spur-a-decidedly-positive-rise-out-of-ai/?sh=38038fb137e5), [MIT Technology Review](https://www.mittrchina.com/news/detail/13596), and other international media. He received best papers awards at several conferences and workshops. He published a book [Introduction to Transfer Learning](http://jd92.wang/tlbook) and gave tutorials at [IJCAI'22](https://dgresearch.github.io/), [WSDM'23](https://dgresearch.github.io/), [KDD'23](https://mltrust.github.io/), [AAAI'24](https://ood-timeseries.github.io/), [AAAI'25](https://llm-understand.github.io/), and [CVPR'25](https://ucsb-mlsec.github.io/cvpr2025-tutorial-Evaluating-Large-Multi-modal-Models-Challenges-and-Methods/). He leads several impactful open-source projects, including [transferlearning](https://github.com/jindongwang/transferlearning), [PromptBench](https://github.com/microsoft/promptbench), [torchSSL](https://github.com/torchssl/torchssl), and [USB](https://github.com/microsoft/Semi-superised-learning), which received over 20K stars. He obtained Ph.D from University of Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2019 with the excellent PhD dissertation award and a bachelor's degree from North China University of Technology in 2014.
