The long-term research goal is to build understand, evaluate, and enhance modern AI models, such as pre-trained and large foundation models. We create new theory, algorithms, applications, and open-sourced library to achieve our goal.
- Machine learning: I'm generally interested in designing algorithms and applications to make machine learning systems more robust, trustworthy, and responsible. Related topics include: machine learning with foundation models, robust machine learning, OOD / domain generalization, transfer learning, semi-supervised learning, federated learning, and related applications.
- Large language models: We mainly focus on understanding the potential and limitation of large foundation models. Related topics: LLM [evaluation](https://llm-eval.github.io/) and [enhancement](https://llm-enhance.github.io/).
- AI for social sciences: How to measure the impact of generative AI on different domains? How to assist interdisciplinary domains using powerful AI models? How to use existing social science knowledge to help us better understand AI behaviors?
